title: Gas Token Limitations

Looking at [Gas Token](https://gastoken.io/) closely, we think:

* For a single developer it is really hard to use it properly cause you have to keep track of the network to know when saving data on the blockchain is at the lowest (or optimal)

* And to know when Free-ing / or destroying contracts would make the most economic sense. (Like selling off an asset, it can be really hard to know when the top is)

* Holding gas token is a hedge only worth taking if you believe that there is a risk of terrible lasting congestions on the network. Or if you certainly don't want your users or yourself to wait.
