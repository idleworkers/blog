In a democracy, the popular way to vote is 1 person, 1 vote. The problem with this approach is that people feel discouraged because dying from a hazard is way more likely than tipping the balance in your favor. What ends up happening for the most part is that people get discouraged and decide not to vote.

The other extreme of spectrum is $1, 1 vote. What you'd realize is the distribution of wealth is very unequal and will keep getting worse. Hence a billionaire can overshadow the rest of the population and vote for laws that are only favorable to him/her and will keep getting him to be richer than anybody else.

(The billionaires could even coordinate their votes, mafia style, so that the middle class and poor can never get out of oppression or slavery).

These 2 ends are pretty unsatisfactory thus far.

Quadratic voting is a scheme. Where for instance, you get to vote as many times you could afford based on how much you want it, with a caveat.

> The more you vote the more expensive it gets to vote.

Quadratic coz, you could visualize the simple curve `x**2` a reasonable increase for 1 or 2 votes, then it drastically becomes expensive really fast. That's an extreme example. Let's say you were in a classroom, voting:

```
* 1st: $1
* 2nd: $2
* 3rd: $3
* 4th: $4
```

If you wanted to vote 4 times, it will cost you: $10 dollars. (versus: $1 for 1 vote, $3 for 2, $6 for 3)

So you could go for 4 votes, but you have to want it more than the opportunity cost of spending the $10 in other things.
